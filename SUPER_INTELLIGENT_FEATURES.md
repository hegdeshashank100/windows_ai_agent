```
You: "I need to create a landing page for my new app"

Agent: "🎨 I'll create a beautiful landing page for you! Based on your preferences for HTML files, I'm making it with modern CSS, responsive design, and eye-catching animations.

✅ Perfect! I've created 'landing-page.html' with a stunning gradient background, professional typography, and interactive elements. The page includes sections for your app features, benefits, and call-to-action buttons.

Would you like me to open it so you can see how amazing it looks?"
```

### **Scenario 2: Context-Aware Follow-ups**

You: "show it to me"

Agent: [Automatically knows you mean the landing page from 30 seconds ago]
"🚀 Opening your landing page now! I remember you like seeing your creations immediately. The responsive design will look great on any device!"

[File opens instantly in browser]
```

### **Scenario 3: Learning and Adaptation**

```
You: "create another webpage about my services"

Agent: [Remembers you prefer modern designs and certain locations]
"🎯 I notice you love creating professional websites! I'm making this one even better than the last, with your preferred modern style. Saving it to your OneDrive Desktop since that's where you usually keep web projects.

✅ Done! Created 'services.html' with the same beautiful styling as your landing page, plus some new features I think you'll love - smooth scrolling, hover effects, and a professional color scheme that matches your brand!"
